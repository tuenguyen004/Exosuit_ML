# Exosuit_ML

Testing a self-made Machine Learning model (neural network) on a mock dataset 
- Preprocessing given data (from .csv files to pd.Dataframe)
- Build the neural layers (converting np.array into 3D tf.tensor)
- Visualize the history/future/predictions with matplotlib 
- Export the trained model & use model.predict() on testing datasets
